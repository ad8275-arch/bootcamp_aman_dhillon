# Jump-Diffusion Enhanced Blackâ€“Scholes Model for European Option Pricing

**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)  
**Date:** August 18, 2025  

---

## Problem Statement
Traditional Blackâ€“Scholes (BS) models are widely used for European option pricing, but they assume continuous price movements.  
In real markets, asset prices often experience sudden jumps due to news shocks, policy changes, or earnings announcements.  

**Problem:** Ignoring these jumps leads to systematic mispricing, especially for out-of-the-money options, which exposes traders and risk managers to unrecognized risks.  

**Solution:** This project extends the Blackâ€“Scholes model with a **jump diffusion process** to capture market shocks while maintaining computational efficiency.  
The result will improve **risk assessment, hedging strategies, and execution quality** for options traders.

##  Stakeholders & Users
- **Decision Maker â€” Risk Management Lead**  
  Ensures pricing models are compliant, realistic, and pass internal model risk governance.  

- **Primary Users â€” Options Traders & Quant Analysts**  
  Need **fast and accurate option values** for hedging, risk monitoring, and trade execution in volatile markets.  

---

## Useful Answer & Decision
- **Type:** Predictive â€” model forecasts option values under jump risk  
- **Metrics:**  
  - *Accuracy* â†’ Error reduction vs. Blackâ€“Scholes baseline  
  - *Robustness* â†’ Reliable across stressed/jump-heavy scenarios  
  - *Speed* â†’ Must run within sub-second latency for trading desk use  
- **Final Artifact:** Python-based pricing engine with a callable API + notebook for scenario analysis  

---

## Assumptions & Constraints
- **Assumptions**
  - Market data is sufficient for calibration of jump intensity & distribution  
  - Jump diffusion improves pricing realism without excessive computational cost
  - Common BS model assumptions.  

- **Constraints**
  - Model must be interpretable to pass **internal model risk governance**  
  - Integration should fit existing **trading architecture** with minimal disruption  

---

## Risks & Known Unknowns
- **Calibration Risk** â†’ Limited historical data on extreme jumps may cause unstable parameter estimates  
- **Model Risk** â†’ Jump diffusion may overfit to rare events, reducing generalizability  
- **Adoption Risk** â†’ Traders may initially distrust the new model compared to familiar Blackâ€“Scholes

##  Expected Output
The final Python-based pricing tool will:  
- Accept **standard market inputs**: stock price, strike price, volatility, risk-free rate, maturity  
- Accept **jump parameters**: jump intensity, jump size distribution  
- Return **European option prices** that reflect real-world jump risk  
- Support **side-by-side comparison**: Blackâ€“Scholes baseline vs. Jump-Diffusion pricing

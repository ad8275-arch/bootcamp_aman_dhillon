## **Project Summary – Regression Model API**

### Overview
- Developed an **end-to-end prototype**:
  - Synthetic data generation
  - Regression model training
  - Model persistence (saved/reloaded)
  - REST API for real-time predictions
  - Simple visualization endpoint

---

###  Key Assumptions
- Data used is **synthetic** (illustrative only).
- Linear regression chosen for **simplicity**, not accuracy.
- API currently uses placeholder logic in some endpoints.

---

###  Results
- Model successfully predicts numeric targets from synthetic features.
- API endpoints provide predictions in real-time.
- Visualization endpoint confirms ability to embed charts in dashboards.

---

### Risks
- Prototype may not generalize to **real business data**.
- Current API lacks **authentication/security**.
- Flask app is **not production-ready** (single-threaded).

---

###  Lifecycle Mapping
1. **Train** → Build simple regression model  
2. **Validate** → Evaluate on synthetic data  
3. **Deploy** → Expose via Flask API  
4. **Monitor** → Track predictions, errors  
5. **Retrain** → Refresh model periodically  

---

###  Next Steps
1. Replace placeholder API logic with trained model outputs.  
2. Integrate real-world datasets.  
3. Implement monitoring dashboard (metrics, errors, drift).  
4. Harden API with authentication and scaling.  
5. Move toward CI/CD and automated retraining.

**Business Takeaway**:  
We now have a working **prototype ML service** demonstrating the full model lifecycle. The next stage is to replace placeholders with production-ready pipelines and integrate with real business data.

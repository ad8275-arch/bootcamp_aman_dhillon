Jump-Diffusion Enhanced BS model on European Option Pricing

Project Scoping
European options are fundamental instruments in global financial markets, but the standard Black–Scholes model assumes continuous asset price movements. In practice, markets often experience sudden jumps due to earnings announcements, geopolitical events, or policy changes. Ignoring these jumps leads to systematic mispricing, particularly for out-of-the-money options, which exposes traders and risk managers to hidden risks.
Traditional jump-aware pricing methods, such as Monte Carlo simulations with jump processes, provide more realistic results but are often too computationally slow for real-time trading. This project aims to solve this issue by implementing a jump diffusion extension of the Black–Scholes model that improves accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, allowing traders and risk managers to better capture market realities without sacrificing speed.
The primary stakeholder is a derivatives risk manager, responsible for ensuring that pricing models reflect true market risks and pass internal model validation standards. The primary users are options traders and quantitative analysts, who need fast, accurate pricing to make informed hedging and trading decisions. The useful answer for this stakeholder group is predictive: the model will forecast option prices under jump diffusion dynamics. The final artifact will be a Python-based pricing tool (script or notebook) that accepts standard market inputs (stock price, strike price, volatility, interest rate, maturity) along with jump parameters, and returns option prices that better reflect real-world conditions.
